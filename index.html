One of my hobbys is playing soccer i practice 3 times a week. I am the youngest out of 5 children. I have 2 pets Suki and are new dog named Telin. I have many friends and most of them are in my courts.

 I spend most of my none busy day either watching tv or helping my mom with anything. I am not a big fan of coding but this class has helped me improve with coding.
